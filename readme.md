### Introduction

This project implements a simple client-server voting system using python socket programming. Client sends commands to server, which handles commands and returns appropriate responses.

Project made as a mandatory task for the INF142 course at UiB.

### Instructions:

1. Start the server by running "python3 server.py" in your terminal.
2. Start the client by running "python3 client.py" in your terminal.

From now on, it is not neccesary to touch the server instance anymore. "terminal" will be referring to the client terminal.

3. type "help" in terminal to get a list of all commands available
4. When using a command that takes arguments (example post), you will be asked for all arguments after command is submitted.
